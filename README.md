# -2-Responsive-Portfolio

A responsive personal website that contains a home section with basic information, a portfolio tab with links to my work, and a contact tab with a form to contact me for projects.

My personal site is deployed at the following url: https://clatrobe00.github.io/-2-Responsive-Portfolio/index.html

My website is responsive for smart devices, and currently functions on both laptop and mobile browsers.

My personal site features a home page:
